# screener-rb-functional
This repo contains an example of a functional test suite integrated with [Screener](https://screener.io).

# Why?
[Screener.io](https://screener.io) is a great tool for doing visual comparison of website versions.  It checks differences in layout, text and structure, and will highlight added, removed or changed elements.

This makes Screener a great tool for ensuring unrelated changes don't impact the look and feel of your site.

Screener can be integrated into a standard functional test suite, which is what this repo demonstrates.

# How?

Computers.  Always Computers.
